# node-qaddy
A project to test, showcase, or debug whatever hot node.js mess Iâ€™m currently working on.

Currently node-qaddy is:

a simple Node.js web application that displays basic information about the server it's running on and the user's browser. Users can add short sentences to a list, sort the list by name, date added, or length, and copy the items in the list to their clipboard. The list is deleted when the user closes their browser.

The app uses the Express framework, Socket.IO, and the EJS template engine.
